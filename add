# Reddit Web Scraper Setup

## Prerequisites

1. Install playwright using pipx (recommended):
```bash
brew install pipx
pipx install playwright
pipx inject playwright playwright
playwright install
```

OR create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

## Usage

Run the scraper:

If using pipx:
```bash
python3 scraper.py
```

If using virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 scraper.py
```

The script will:
- Use Playwright to scrape Reddit directly (no API keys needed)
- Fetch top 1000 posts from r/askreddit for the current year (2025)
- Extract post title, author, score, and top 5 comments for each post
- Save all data to `askreddit_top_posts_2025.json`

Note: This scraper uses old.reddit.com for easier parsing and is respectful with delays between requests.

## Output Format

The JSON file will contain an array of post objects with this structure:
```json
{
  "title": "Post title",
  "author": "username",
  "score": 12345,
  "num_comments": 678,
  "created_date": "2025-01-01T12:00:00+00:00",
  "url": "https://reddit.com/...",
  "top_comments": [
    {
      "author": "commenter",
      "body": "Comment text",
      "score": 123
    }
  ]
}
```
