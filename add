# Reddit Web Scraper Setup

## Prerequisites

1. Initialize UV project and install playwright:
```bash
uv sync
uv run playwright install
```

## Usage

Run the scraper:
```bash
uv run python scraper.py
```

The script will:
- Use Playwright to scrape Reddit directly (no API keys needed)
- Fetch top 1000 posts from r/askreddit for the current year (2025)
- Extract post title, author, score, and top 5 comments for each post
- Save all data to `askreddit_top_posts_2025.json`

Note: This scraper uses old.reddit.com for easier parsing and is respectful with delays between requests.

## Output Format

The JSON file will contain an array of post objects with this structure:
```json
{
  "title": "Post title",
  "url": "https://reddit.com/...",
  "top_comments": [
    {
      "body": "Comment text"
    }
  ]
}
```
